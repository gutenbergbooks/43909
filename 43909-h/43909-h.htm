THIS is a story of the initial cruise
of "Sometub"&mdash;a narrative of the
voyage of the newest type boat on
America's oldest improved waterway.
We exalted 30 cent gasoline
and eased our conscience by following
in the patriotic footsteps of
George Washington.</div>

<p>Amid nature's most magnificent
scenery we linked the romance of
yesterday with the humdrum of the
workaday present. We established
a new maxim, namely: To avoid the
beaten path take the towpath!</p>

<p>We enjoyed to the superlative degree
the rare privilege of "Seeing America First," because
we saw it as the first American saw it.</p>

</div>
<div  class="drop-cap">THE cruise of the "Sometub" began
at Oakmont on the Allegheny river
in Pennsylvania and ended in Rock
Creek in the shadow of the national
capitol in the District of Columbia.
In a total distance of 347 miles the
little craft traversed six navigable
waterways. Of course, there was a
portage of 150 miles, but this was
accomplished without inconvenience and provided a seasonable
period to re-provision the boat. Moreover, the
150-mile trip overland demonstrated the advantage of a
portable cruiser&mdash;of which "Sometub" has the distinction
of being the first in its class.</div>

<p>"Sometub" narrowly escaped being christened
"Kitchen Maid." It is literally a kitchen-made craft,
that is, it was put together in the kitchen after its knockdown
frame was received from a Michigan boatbuilder.
When culinary activities in the aforesaid kitchen were
partially suspended it afforded an ideal boatyard, but
the fact that a kitchen would be put to such extraordinary
use there was attracted thither a constant line of
spectators, the majority of whom had as little nautical
knowledge as the builders. Propped up on a stepladder
the bony frame of the future boat looked like one of
those uncanny paleontological specimens in the Carnegie
museum, and drew from the visitors a flow of remarks
entirely irrelevant to boatbuilding. Nearly everyone
doubted that the thing would be made to float, but a
few who were too polite to express their views went to
the opposite extreme and indulged in a line of flattery
that was more irritating than the skeptcism of the doubting
Thomases.</p>

<p>"Well, that's some tub!" The oft repeated phrase
trickled away somewhere into the damaged wall paper
of the kitchen or into the big paint spot that ruined the
linoleum, and when the time came to name the boat the
words came back sufficiently anglicized and properly
compounded&mdash;"Sometub." And it stuck!</p>

<p>"Sometub" has been laughed at by hundreds of persons
who will never know how it received its name. It
looks less tub-like than the majority of motorboats. The
Brooks Manufacturing Company up in Saginaw, from
whom I bought the knockdown frame, doubtless would
object to the innuendo suggesting tubbiness because
they boast of it as one of their latest and most graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
models&mdash;a semi-V bottom shape which is especially
noted both for speed and seaworthiness. And it is all
they claim for it, and more, too!</p>

<p>"Sometub" is 15 feet long by 43 inches on the
beam. We took liberties with the Brooks plan by constructing
a bulkhead which enclosed five feet of the
bow. This left a 10-foot cockpit, over which was erected
a portable canopy top. Curtains that hung on the sides
of the canopy made a snug cabin 10 × 3½ feet. For motive
power we use an Evinrude motor. By the way, it is one
of those coffee mill affairs that you screw on the stern
of a skiff or rowboat. "Sometub" was designed for this
very sort of equipment and the theory worked out beautifully&mdash;until
the motor went wrong. And there lies the
key to all the villainy that will be divulged in this plain
tale of the cruise of "Sometub" from Oakmont to Washington.</p>

<p>On account of the 150-mile portage from Pittsburgh
to Cumberland, Md., it is advisable to allow seven days
from the time of your departure on the Allegheny until
your expected sailing from the other terminal of the portage.
In these seven days you will make the run down to
the Pittsburgh Baltimore &amp; Ohio freight station at Water
street, pack your engine and duffle, bail out the boat,
cart it to the Cumberland local freight car, see it stowed
away and spend four days hoping that it will arrive in
Cumberland before you and your cargo. Of course,
your hopes will be blasted, but to hope is human. Anyhow,
you might as well realize at the outset that cross-country
cruising is to be an intensely human experience.</p>

<p>There was no ceremony when we backed out of a
stall at the Oakmont Boat Club in the late afternoon of
the 9th of last July and picked our way between the
bathers, canoes and rowboats that clustered there. Even
if there had been occasion for ceremony, the thought
that we had to reach the Aspinwall lock before 6 o'clock
or wait another hour, "on the hour," caused us to lay
a course straight for Nine-mile Island. With its balky
Evinrude five miles an hour is "Sometub's" best speed.
Past colonies of summer camps on the O'Hara township
bank of the Allegheny we continued our way hearing a
giggle now and then as a maid in a canoe or on shore
caught sight of the aluminum letters on our bow and
spelled out "S-o-m-e-t-u-b." The tables were turned
when we passed the "Ye Gauds" camp. Phonetic spelling
is epidemic among river campers. Their's is not simplified,
but rather perplexified spelling.</p>

<p>For a mile above Aspinwall dam the Allegheny in
breezy weather has all the choppiness of a landlocked
lake and affords the exhileration of boating that is enjoyed
on a much larger body of water. Here we witnessed
a scene that was in strange contrast with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
gayety farther up the river. Below the mouth of Squaw
Run a group of terrifed children stood on the bank intently
watching a skiff which was being rowed slowly
down stream. At the oars was a youth vainly trying
to look brave while at the stern a grizzled riverman
dragged a grappling iron. It was the sequel to an old
story. They were searching for the body of a boy who
had been drowned an hour before while trying to exchange
seats in a canoe.</p>

<p>To make the Aspinwall lock on schedule time is
always cause for joy by the humble owner of a motorboat.
If he is not there "on the hour" he must wait
until another 60 minutes have elapsed before the opening
of the gates, unless a towboat should happen along.
The same rule is in force at Lock No. 1 at Herr's Island.
Here we arrived "in between times," but the gates were
open and we started in. A lock tender caught sight
of "Sometub" and waved frantically for us to get out
and tie up alongside a barge which lay near the shore.
Astern was the towboat Crucible making her way into
the lock with a steel boat in tow. We followed the locktender's
directions, but when the big craft approached
and the pilot had sized us up, he stepped out on the
hurricane deck and pointed a place for us to tie in the
lock. When our motor began to sputter and he saw the
name of the boat he laughed heartily and seemed to
share our delight in getting into the lock chamber ahead
of the Crucible. We soon chugged out and 15 minutes
later rounded the Point, anointing "Sometub" for the
first time with the waters of the Ohio. Running up the
Monongahela in the twilight we moored at the motorboat
landing at the foot of Smithfield street. Here
the boat was taken from the water and shipped to Cumberland.</p>

<p>I have said that we eased our conscience by following
the patriotic footsteps of George Washington.
We struck the sacred trail in the first hour of our cruise
when, running down the Allegheny we scudded under
the decrepit Forty-third street bridge and past the historic
point that once was separated from the mainland
and was known as Wainwright's Island. From this point
until the end of the journey we were constantly on
ground intimately associated with the life of Washington.</p>

<p>Indeed if it had not been for the enterprise of Washington
the cruise never would have been possible; if it
had not been for Washington the Chesapeake and Ohio
canal would not have been projected, and without this
pioneer waterway the valley of the upper Potomac would
be a solitary wilderness. The Baltimore and Ohio railroad
only followed its aquatic pacemaker and was
pushed westward over the identical route Washington
had laid out for his canal to connect the waters of
the Potomac with those of the tributaries of the Ohio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the eastern link of the intercontinental route which he
dreamed would some day connect the Atlantic seaboard
with the great lakes, and the Mississippi valley. The
Lake Erie and Ohio river ship canal is but a revival of
Washington's gigantic project. "The Father of His
Country" was a century and a half ahead of the times
in his comprehension of the transportation problem.</p>

<p>The history of the construction of this canal is a
commercial romance replete with many a fascinating
chapter involving personal peril, adventures, triumphs,
failures and political intrigue; for four bloody years
during the Civil war its right of way was held alternately
by the Union and the Confederate armies, and many
a grim tragedy was enacted there; today it is one of
the few places in the country where the oldtime canal
boat is to be seen in practical operation.</p>

<p>But the story of the canal will come further along.
It is essential in the narrative of the initial cruise of
"Sometub" because its towpath, worn by 20 successive
progenies of mules, is the path that paradoxically leads
far, far away from the beaten path of modern travel.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, July 15th, we reached Cumberland.
Rain was falling but this did not deter us
from launching "Sometub" in the waters of the canal.
We had made up our minds that rain must be disregarded&mdash;and
subsequent experience proved that this step
toward resignation to the elements was well taken. Before
the voyage was three days old we realized that
Jupiter Pluvius was a stowaway with us. For 100 miles
we were the harbingers of showers, the advance agents
of thunder, lightning, rain and cloudbursts.</p>

<p>We had hoped to leave Cumberland before sunset
and tie up for the night far from the noise of the city,
but the best we could do between showers was to put
everything in shipshape and wait for the dawn. Rain
pattered down all night long and came in repeated gusts
during the day. In the meantime we sat on the hospitable
porch of a retired canal boat skipper and listened
to his reminiscences of the "good old days." Our delay
just now was due to our failure to procure our
waybill, a document which gave us the right of way
through the locks from Cumberland to Georgetown. In
this document "Sometub" was put down as a motor-propelled
craft of one ton net register and stipulated
that it should proceed at a speed not exceeding four
miles an hour. The waybill cost $5.10.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we were informed that a
deputy collector of the port, who lived "down the canal
beyond the bridge," would hand us our waybill as we
passed. Simultaneously with this good news the rain
ceased and the sun came out in radiant glory. In two
minutes we were away and broke the speed limit with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the impunity of a motor driver who knows that if he
does not exceed the legal speed his machine will stop
altogether. We made a dash for the waybill. "Pshaw!"
exclaimed the collector. "It's too bad I didn't know the
name of your boat. I just wrote 'launch.' If I had known
it had a name like that I would have put it down, sure."</p>

<p>"What are the rules?" we asked him.</p>

<p>"Keep to the left&mdash;always&mdash;that's all. Tie up on
the berm side (to the left) and don't let yourself get
dragged into the flume by the current at the locks." We
thanked him and started again. We rounded the big
bend of the Potomac, turning to the eastward where
the blue horizon of the mountains melted into the blue-gray
mists and clouds of the weeping sky. In what
seemed an increditably short time we had left the city
behind and glided along the vine-fringed, ribbon-like
pool that wound its way into sequestered solitudes
among the towering hills. Here and there a farmhouse
was visible in the distance on the uplands and
occasionally a lonely cabin squatted among the willows
and dank weeds that grew in the marshy places, but for
the greater part of our run on this level we hugged close
to the hillside or proceeded through courses of broad
meadows.</p>

<p>It was the first time an outboard motor cruiser had
been seen on the canal, and for that matter in the Potomac
valley, and "Sometub" attracted much attention
among the country folk and the crews of the boats. We
passed our first canal boat beyond South Cumberland at
a point where the channel was scarcely 30 feet wide and
narrowly escaped rasping off our propeller on a ledge
of rocks that formed the berm bank, our danger being
due to the provokingly deliberate action of the steersman
on the big mule-drawn hulk. After that we waited
for sufficient leeway before attempting to pass canal
boats in narrow channels.</p>

<p>At sunset a whitewashed log house came into view
and as we approached we recognized the huge arms of
the lock gates. Beyond the locktender's cabin we saw
the roofs of the houses in the little village of North
Branch, Md. Here was our first lock, the first of the
75 in 184 miles on the canal between Cumberland and
Georgetown. We were curious to know how "Sometub"
would behave in an old-fashioned lock with leaky gates
and were anxious to push on to the tunnel some 30 miles
east of Cumberland where the canal for nearly a mile
of its course passes underneath one of the lofty ridges
of the Alleghanies. Ominous clouds in the west hastened
the approaching night. The proximity of a shelter in
case of a heavy rainstorm caused us to accept the locktender's
hospitality to tie up for the night alongside the
flume at the head of the lock.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Making the boat fast to the lockhouse we lighted
our oil lantern, dropped the side curtains and disregarded
the returning rain while we prepared dinner on
two small stoves formed by a pair of tripod rings containing
cans of solid alcohol. Motor boating creates a
genuine appetite and we had all the facilities for preparing
a good dinner in the smallest possible space.
The deck of "Sometub" provided a dry place for the
storing of bedding, dishes and supplies and there was
no crowding at mealtime. After dinner we wrote up the
log, spread a mattress in the bottom of the boat, fastened
down the curtains and retired early.</p>

<p>The night was inky dark. The lights in the locktender's
dwelling were extinguished before 9 o'clock
and the denizens of the village of North Branch, several
hundred yards away, seemed to seek repose at the same
hour. The solitude of the place grew oppressive. About
midnight we were aroused by a shriek that pierced the
night air and echoed back from the mountains across
the river. Parting the curtains, we saw two sheeted
forms on the towpath, their ghostly outlines standing
out against the cloudy sky, while the waters of the canal
reflected a pair of shimmering specters which at first
glance were calculated to make the average stranger
wish that he made this trip in a Pullman car.</p>

<p>Again the shrieking broke forth and the sheeted
forms began to move. We were undergoing our initiation
in night traveling on the canal, but we didn't realize
it at the time.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap2'>OF THOSE ghosts that are simply ghosts I have no
fear. Some persons whistle when they pass
country graveyards after dark in order, they say,
to keep up courage; for the same reason I sometimes
whistle on Broadway. Specters are harmless if they
do not assume material form. The apparitions on the
Chesapeake and Ohio canal towpath soon lost their
ethereal quality in our vision and the unearthly noise
that accompanied their manifestation translated itself
into "you black-hearted, ornery, low-lifed beggar&mdash;geddap!"</div>

<p>There was a familiar rattle of harness. The specters
moved again, but more quickly this time. Against
the black infiniteness of the mountains across the river
were the shadowy forms of a pair of gray mules hitched
in tandem. Wearily they plodded off, and moving slowly,
tediously, silently behind them a canal boat followed
along at the end of an invisible towline.</p>

<p>A canal boat at night is a great hulk of hush. Its
silence is positively uncanny. A few ripples momentarily
disturb the placid surface of the water but as they
swirl around the craft they seem to beckon a state of
funereal quietude. You can hardly blame the midnight
driver of the canal boat for his profane vociferousness
in addressing his mules. His voice alone breaks the
death-like stillness. After the lock has been passed and
the patient animals take up their gait, even he is overcome
by the environment and relapses into drowsy silence.</p>

<p>At intervals through the night other specters appeared
over there on the towpath and their advent invariably
was heralded by the same hair-raising shouts.
The noise of cussing the poor mules followed as certainly
as the agonizing "low music" during tense
moments in a melodrama.</p>

<p>Tardy dawn ushered in a gloomy day. We placed
our "canned heat" range on a lumber pile beside the
North Branch lockhouse and had our coffee and bacon
progressing satisfactorily toward the proper elements of
an al fresco breakfast when rain began to fall. We retreated
to the boat. The rain continued unabated and
we breakfasted on board. Inasmuch as we were obliged
to keep the curtains down and tuck the baggage under
a poncho, it was impracticable&mdash;we thought&mdash;to proceed
on our journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The locktender's office at North Branch has seen
service for more than half a century. We can testify
to this because after we had sought its shelter and read
all the magazines bought on the beginning of the trip
we turned to a perusal of the lockmaster's records.
These books date back to the 60's and it was fascinating
to read on the faded pages the entries for the boats and
cargoes of a by-gone era. The boats now operating are
distinguished by numbers from 1 to 100, but in the old
days they bore names, suggestive, no doubt, of their
architecture and other characteristics, or of the ambition
of their owners.</p>

<p>Noon brought no cessation of the rain. We ate
luncheon in the office. "Star boarders" could not have
reported more promptly at meal time. Good appetites
were the most encouraging features of this portion of
the trip. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the skies cleared
slightly and in a few minutes we resumed our voyage.
The three locks at North Branch, Nos. 75, 74 and 73,
respectively, were negotiated in less than 15 minutes and
we found ourselves on "Oldtown level."</p>

<p>In the language of the boatmen and the denizens
of the canal country all geographical distinctions are
made strictly "on the level." A "level," we learned, is
that stretch of the canal between two given locks. From
Cumberland to Georgetown (Washington) there are 75
locks, and consequently the same number of levels,
plus one.</p>

<p>There is an ancient and honorable superstition to
the effect that the person who sets out on a journey and
turns back is certain to meet with disappointment. Ten
minutes after we departed from North Branch we remembered
that we had left our maps behind in the lockmaster's
office. The maps, United States Geological
Survey quadrangles, were indispensable and we turned
back. Prompt and speedy came our disappointment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>OLDTOWN LEVEL is about 10 miles long. We estimated
that we could reach Oldtown village in
about two hours. While the idle hours had dragged
along in the sleepy hamlet of North Branch we
looked forward longingly to Oldtown. The name sounded
enchanting and moreover we were told that we could
procure gasoline, groceries and our favorite brands of
confectionery there. After running merrily about seven
miles our motor stopped cold. No amount of coaxing
would make it run. Gathering clouds betokened a resumption
of the rain. No human habitation was in
sight.</div>

<p>The motor's affliction was difficult of diagnosis, but
its trouble appeared to be serious. I had just made up
my mind that the boat would have to be paddled or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
towed to the end of the level when Canal Boat No. 14
eased along. The skipper inquired we were "in trouble."
It was mere charity and politeness of him to ask, because
the expression on our faces must have told him
that we regarded our condition as one of dire distress.</p>

<p>"His en-jine's done busted," shouted the little ragged
muleteer as he passed us on his plodding animals.</p>

<p>"Ketch the line," advised the skipper, while we
grasped the piece of rope he tossed toward us. Making
his rope fast to a cleat on the bow we saw "Sometub"
humiliated by being towed at the stern of a slow-moving
freight boat towed in turn by two decrepit mules. "Sometub"
felt the disgrace keenly and jerked about like an
unbroken colt that feels a rein for the first time. Only
strenuous use of the paddle as a steering oar kept the
proud little boat in the channel. In this way we moved
stupidly into Oldtown. An hour and a half was required
to go less than three miles.</p>

<p>On reaching the lock at Oldtown it was apparent
that there would not be room between the gates to accommodate
both the canal boat and "Sometub," and the
skipper cast us off in a fashion so uncermonious that
we floated in his wake feeling like unbidden guests at
a feast. The big freight boat glided away, leaving us on
the wrong side of the gate. You know how sometimes
you turn and drive away the homeless dog that sheepishly
follows you down the street? Well, we felt placed in
the situation of the homeless dog.</p>

<p>It was the first time in my life that I experienced
a sincere desire to embrace the teachings of anarchy.
After the canal boat had started on its way Mr. Carter,
the lockmaster, returned to inquire into our wants.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with us?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Lock you through," he answered. "Give me your
line and I'll tow you in. Then you can tie up over there
and stop at my house all night. My wife will have a
nice hot supper for you. The gentleman who runs the
store up on the hill has an automobile and knows a lot
about gas engines. I know he'll be delighted to fix up
your machine."</p>

<p>It was hard to believe that he meant what he said.
He had enunciated that kind of hospitality which I had
thought no longer existed except in books that sell at
$1.08. My wife, however, did not share my skepticism.
Here was good old-fashioned southern hospitality and
she emphasized the fact with some pride that we were
now well over the Mason &amp; Dixon line and might expect
cordiality to be something more than a meaningless
phrase. She rushed across the towpath to chat with the
lockmaster's wife and daughters while Mr. Carter towed
"Sometub" through the lock and found a suitable place
to tie up on the berm bank of the short level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>OLDTOWN, I believe, was called Oldtown even in
its younger days. I believe also that now in its
boast of municipal veneration it looks younger
than it did in its youth. The wrinkled visage of great
age is in strange contrast with its modern affectations.
Personify it and you would have the picture of a centenarian
doing a fox trot. Oldtown is one of the oldest
settlements in western Maryland and it dwelt on in a
kind of proud senility until West Virginia went "dry."
Being on the border Oldtown possessed a situation of
peculiar strategic value. It afforded the opportunity for
the establishment of an exceedingly "wet" outpost, and
the opportunity did not go begging. In consequence the
chief enterprise of Oldtown is slaking the thirsts of
West Virginians from many miles up and down the Potomac.
The structures that domicile these establishments
form a cluster of new buildings that gives Oldtown
something of the appearance of a boom town in the
west. A sincere opponent of the liquor traffic would be
justified in saying that Oldtown is in its second childhood.</div>

<p>With many thanks we declined the hospitality of
the whole-souled lockmaster and his family and cooked
our dinner in a drizzling rain and "tinkered" on the
motor until after midnight. The knowledge that we were
among friends enabled us to make ourselves comfortable
for the night regardless of the weather.</p>

<p>In the morning we were awakened by a call from
Mr. Carter. He came to give me "a lift" with the motor.
As a last forlorn hope I gave the flywheel a twirl&mdash;and
it went! We made all haste to depart and before the
sun had reached the mountain tops we were under way.
With good behavior on the part of the motor "Sometub"
is the spryest young boat you ever saw, and on this
Tuesday, July 18th, we made our record run. The sky
was cloudless and out in the meadows we watched farmers
and harvest hands sweltering in the broiling sun,
but in the shade of the stately trees that form an arch
over the canal in this region we enjoyed a delightful
atmosphere. Steep cliffs enclose the north bank of
the canal and over these in luxuriant profusion were
seemingly endless brambles of blackberry vines burdened
with luscious ripe fruit. For luncheon we skirted
the cliffs and picked a dish of berries which with
crackers and tea enabled us to have a unique and delicious
repast without tying up the boat.</p>

<p>Our logbook for this day contains nevertheless
many entries of enforced stops. Wild grass growing up
in the bottom of the canal checked us frequently and
necessitated removing long coils that choked the propeller.
Shortly after noon we reached the tunnel which
carries the waters of the canal for seven-eighths of a
mile under one of the lofty ridges of the Alleghanies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The channel is barely wide enough to allow the passage
of a single craft and we knew that we must hold the
right of way or back out in case we should meet a canal
boat. The tunnel has no lights and when you get into
its depths it is a veritable black hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Fixing our red and green running lights we started
bravely in, but after going a dozen yards we struck
windrows of grass and weeds which made it impossible
for our propeller to turn. There was but one thing to
do, and I climbed out on the narrow shelf of a towpath
and took the end of the line while my better, and on
this occasion, less nervous half, caught up the paddle
and steered. The towpath in the tunnel is intended only
for mules. In many places are mountain springs whose
icy waters trickle down through the old brick walls and
transform the towpath into soft mire that is knee deep.
It was the longest seven furlongs I ever trod and I came
out of the tunnel with a feeling of profound respect
for the canal boat mule.</p>

<p>Our cruise during the remainder of the afternoon
was delightful. Here is the wildest scenery in the upper
Potomac valley and there are few settlements. The
locktenders were the only persons we saw for hours
at a time and the locks were few. Likewise on this
part of our run we passed no boats. We felt real neighborly
toward the train crews on the Baltimore and Ohio
and Western Maryland railroads when they condescended
to look at us as they sped past. For miles, however,
no railroad was in sight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>A COUNTRY store keeper at Little Orleans, who
dealt in everything from women's "fashionable
gowns" to fresh fish and from "near beer" to
gasoline, enabled us to continue our voyage without
delay. From him we purchased a supply of gasoline,
oil and tobacco&mdash;three important items for the "engine
room." When the motor is out of order the consumption
of tobacco is particularly heavy.</div>

<p>In the twilight we passed the village of Pearre and
at dark drew up alongside the dock of the Woodmont
Hunting and Fishing Club. Dinner was late this night
but the weather was perfect and no fashionable restaurant
could have offered more inviting surroundings for
the diner with an appetite whetted by a day of toil in
the great outdoors. We sat in the boat and used the
dock for a table. And we would not have exchanged the
privilege for the finest mahogany ever turned out!</p>

<p>We were in Dixie now, sure enough. On the clubhouse
porch up on the hill a party of young people
were holding a dance which was enlivened by singing
oldtime songs that recalled our presence in the beloved
Southland. As two tired voyagers dropped off to slumber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
they heard the sweet strains of an inspiring melody
that floated on the still night air far across the Potomac
hills&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>For life and death, for woe and weal,<br />
Thy peerless chivalry reveal,<br />
And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel,<br />

<h2>III.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap2'>"THE HEART OF MARYLAND" is quite as elusive,
geographically, as the phrase is trite. After being
lulled to sleep at Woodmont by the old wartime
song and awakened on a sunny morning by the carols
of thrush and mockingbird, we felt that the enchanted
land of romance in the old Cavalier commonwealth
must indeed be near at hand.</div>

<p>We made no haste to leave the hospitable dock at
Woodmont. The day was ideal and our camera was
chaffing under long idleness. I had passed this point
a score of times on daylight trains of the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad and longed for an opportunity to tarry
here. On our voyage in "Sometub" we realized the oft-repeated
wish and made the most of it.</p>

<p>A heartless motor, however, robbed the "heart of
Maryland" of much of its heartsomeness&mdash;for us. Leaving
Woodmont about the middle of the forenoon on
Wednesday, July 19, we ran past the ancient settlement
of Sir John's Run, proceeded on under the shadow of
Round Mountain, in Maryland, and picturesque Lover's
Leap, in West Virginia, and glided into the prosperous
looking town of Hancock shortly after 2 o'clock. Hancock
gained fame in the winter of 1861-62 when Stonewall
Jackson, from the hills south of the Potomac,
deigned to throw a few shells into this Maryland village.
It was not a sanguinary battle, but at that early
period in the war it was considered a bold thing for the
Confederate leader to do, and for the time being disturbed
the "alls-quiet-along-the-Potomac" that had become
stereotyped in the reports of the military situation
farther down the stream. At Hancock a short spur of
the Baltimore and Ohio runs up to Berkley Springs, a
watering place that boasts of patronage by Virginia
aristocrats back in George Washington's time.</p>

<p>Resolved that we would forego the luxury of luncheon
on board, we tied up under the highway bridge, left
"Sometub" in charge of the toll-keeper and strolled
into town. At the hotel we were too late for dinner
and were told that the dining room would not be open
for the service of supper until 6 o'clock. In desperation
we sought a restaurant&mdash;and in two minutes regretted
that we had not prepared our own luncheon on the
boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="600" height="428" alt="Photograph" />
<div class="caption">Picturesque Water Mill Beside the Potomac</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Isn't it peculiar how the smallest trifles will alter
the most elaborate plans? A trifling ham sandwich
in a two by four restaurant caused us to evacuate
Hancock forthwith. We had intended to remain
here a day or longer, run over to Berkley Springs and
perhaps go fishing. Instead we left town so precipitately
that we forgot to stop at the postoffice and ask
if our mail had been forwarded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>A &nbsp; FEW miles east of Hancock is a wide-water a mile
long in the canal known as Little Pool, the channel
being about the width of the Monongahela
river at the Smithfield street bridge. From Hancock to
this point we were obliged to stop frequently on account
of grass that clogged the propeller, and on entering
Little Pool the obstruction was so great that it was
necessary to get out and tow several hundred yards.
When clear water was regained the motor began to show
signs of balking, and after a heart-rending effort to
repair it on the towpath, we threw the thing into the
boat and paddled our way through the rural hamlet of
Millstone where housewives, milking their cows on the
bank of the canal, stared at us pityingly as we labored
by. Cow stables and pig stys on the berm bank offered
no mooring place in the town, and we plied the paddle
until we reached a secluded stretch of woodland where
we could be alone in our chagrin over the obstinacy of
the motor.</div>

<p>When we lighted our lantern we were annoyed for
the first time by a swarm of mosquitoes. We had been
warned before the trip that these insects on the canal
were related to the Jersey "man-eaters" and would
make life miserable on our cruise. We were prepared
for their ravages, but fortunately a little breeze sprang
up after nightfall and they gave us no more trouble.
They were the only militant mosquitoes that we saw
between Cumberland and Georgetown.</p>

<p>As if gloating over our discomfiture in having lost
our motive power, a double-bass bullfrog started in to
make the night hideous. His favorite singing dias was
in the pool right under the bow of the boat. When a
stone was thrown in his direction he retreated into
deep water, but invariably returned. Late in the night
I hit upon the expedient of pouring a pint of 30-cent
gasoline on the water. The croaker croaked no more.</p>

<p>In the morning a little tinkering was rewarded by
the motor showing signs of renewing operations and we
started in high hopes, but after a few hundred rods
it was apparent that we were making little speed and we
limped into the tiny hamlet of Ernestville where we
stopped for supplies and fresh water. Ernestville is
a poor shopping center and fresh water and kerosene
were about all we could obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Along this stretch of the canal it is paralleled for
a considerable distance by the old National Pike, which
on this particular morning was thronged by automobile
tourists. As they sped by we knew that they would
be in Hagerstown in an hour. We wondered if we
would reach there in a day. It was apparent now that
we must take our crippled motor to a garage and
Hagerstown was the nearest point where we could obtain
the services of a mechanic skilled in repairing marine
engines. To reach Hagerstown from the canal we
decided to stop at Williamsport and this was now our
goal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>BIG POOL is a widewater where the canal broadens
into a beautiful lake nearly a mile wide and more
than a mile long. Our balky motor pushed us
into this big sheet of water and then stopped with a
derisive screech. It was the ultimatum of a dry bearing
and it was inexorable. While we were floundering
in the breeze and trying to paddle ashore, a motorboat
came alongside and its occupants inspected our equipment.
"Sometub" they liked immensely, but the engine
perplexed them. We were looking for neither advice
nor sympathy and the stranger who acted very superior
and said, "I have a Koban," didn't improve his favor in
our eyes.</div>

<p>Then into our lives came a heroic figure. Just at
that moment he appeared the greatest man in the world&mdash;philanthropist,
navigator, philosopher! He was the
skipper of Canal Boat No. 18 which swept majestically
down the pool. His boat appeared as big and formidable
as the new superdreadnaught Pennsylvania. Dexterous
work with the paddle enabled us to get in its lee.
Up there on his quarterdeck stood the skipper. I since
believe that he must have resembled Noah, but to we
two&mdash;we felt like castaways&mdash;he was indeed a mighty
admiral. But he was the admiral of a friendly power
and amid all his dignity there was a benign expression
also of stern consideration for a brother mariner in
distress. We gazed at him and his noble craft in mute
appeal.</p>

<p>"Ketch the line!"</p>

<p>Like spent swimmers grasping for a straw, we
seized the line and made it fast. For the second time
"Sometub" was humiliated by being towed by a prosaic
freight boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="500" height="825" alt="two photographs" />
<div class="caption">Above&mdash;Upper Level at Four Locks<br />Below&mdash;Old-Time Mill</div>
</div>

<p>Two miles an hour is top speed for a laden canal
boat and No. 18's tired mules kept well inside this limit.
At the end of the towline we nosed along in perfect
complacency. We chatted with the skipper, admired
the scenery, examined our maps of the route, chaffed
the villagers, ate our luncheon, jogged the motor, read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a little, took short naps and made ourselves absolutely
comfortable. Our only effort was to keep on the shady
side of the boat, for the weather was the hottest we
had endured. As a remedy for tired nerves I can testify
to the curative qualities of canalboating.</p>

<p>The skipper was a man of parts. He had run the
canal for more than 20 years. He had walked every
inch of the towpath from Cumberland to Washington
every hour of the day and night and he declared that
he could pace those 184 miles with his eyes blindfolded.
He recognized every hill and house and tree and could
tell their history. He knew all the neighborhood gossip,
and all the neighbors knew him.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the drowsy afternoon we floated
into the little village of Four Locks which takes its
name from the fact that a chain of four locks are here.
No. 18 cast us off and we prepared to paddle through.
To our surprise the motor condescended to run. At the
time I was ready to believe that it heard the mule
driver's sublime cussing and was frightened into obedience.</p>

<p>With the motor running again we soon passed No.
18 and snorted off around a sharp bend, through Two
Locks where we were lowered into the waters of the
Potomac. I say "snorted" advisedly. "Sometub" exhibited
colt-like behavior when unleashed from the
slow-moving canal craft. The towpath follows the
northern bank of the river and the boats hug the shore
closely, but we careened far out into the stream. "Sometub"
had found a nautical playground more spacious
than it had ever enjoyed before.</p>

<p>After a two-mile run on the river we entered another
lock and once more were confined to the comparatively
narrow channel of the canal. We found all conditions
favorable and at sunset we crossed the great
stone aqueduct over the winding Conococheague and
a few minutes later tied up at the Williamsport lock.</p>

<p>I was now on familiar ground. Eleven years before
I had visited historic Williamsport in quest of
newspaper "feature stories," and a decade had witnessed
but little change in the place. In the early days of the
Federal government Williamsport was a pretentious bidder
as the seat for the national capital. In the Civil
War it was a sort of Pryzmyl, having been taken and
retaken by the armies of both the north and the south,
but the town itself was of no importance except as the
key to strategic positions beyond. Here in June, 1863,
the vanguard of Lee's conquering legions crossed the
Potomac when they swept down the Shenandoah and
crossed triumphantly into Pennsylvania, and here less
than a month later their ragged columns made a bold
stand against Meade's victorious forces while the retreating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Confederates waited for the flood to subside
so that they could withdraw into Virginia. Along the
street that leads down to the river are many of the
old houses whose walls resounded with the tread
of those valiant armies&mdash;Union and Confederate. In
those houses, too, many a soldier suffered the agony of
wounds received in the desperate charges at Gettysburg.
Of those southern heroes who raced with death from
that immortal field, scores gave up their lives here in
sight of their native Virginia hills.</p>

<p>Williamsport today is another of those outposts for
supplying alcoholic drinks to bleary-eyed pilgrims from
West Virginia and in consequence does not afford hotel
accommodations for the ordinary traveler. After trying
in vain to get dinner, we boarded a trolley car and 40
minutes later reached Hagerstown where we stopped for
the night, enjoying the solid luxury of a "room with
bath connecting."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>AMONG Hagerstown's well known business men is
Mr. Walter E. Pattison, a former Pittsburgher.
We sent him a grape-vine telegram of our advent
in town and on coming down from breakfast in the
morning he hailed us with a motorcar and an invitation
for a drive through Greater Hagerstown. We accepted
with alacrity, remembering the tedious hours of the previous
day, and made no objection when the chauffeur
cut up didoes with the Maryland speed limit.</div>

<p>Mr. Pattison accompanied us to Williamsport in
the afternoon to see "Sometub" and to join a little reunion
with Col. George W. McCardell, the veteran editor
of the Williamsport <i>Leader</i>. Editor McCardell had been
looking for me for eleven years and we were somewhat
in doubt as to the outcome of the interview. The reason
for his desire to lay hands on me was, as nearly as I
can remember, the following paragraph which was printed
over my name in the Pittsburgh <i>Gazette</i> in the summer
of 1905:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Williamsport Leader is more than a
journalistic enterprise&mdash;it is a well founded
institution. It is the oracle of rockribbed Democracy,
the unflinching champion of pure Jeffersonism
and unfaltering Andyjacksonism....
The editor will take two pairs of Maryland
frying-size chickens on subscription, but of his
Virginia subscribers he requires three pairs in
advance because, he says, the Maryland pullets
are better and more tender.</p></blockquote>

<p>I resolved to meet the editor and finish the argument.
Mr. Pattison led the way to a new and prosperously
attractive sanctum. It was publication day&mdash;Friday&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Col. McCardell, after a strenuous week,
stood with folded arms beside an imposing stone with
type still wet from the day's "run." My wife, who embodies
the traditions of five generations of the editor's
brand of politics but who stood ready to defend the
quality of Virginia chicken against the world, was the
first to enter the den of the journalistic lion. It was a
clever ruse on Mr. Pattison's part, for first of all Col.
McCardell is a chivalrous southern gentleman. Why, of
course, Virginia fried chicken is the finest in the land.
And Virginia women compose the very flower of American
womanhood. Their presence here is welcomed
like the May-time sunshine. The Potomac ripples softly
when they cross the river and in the trees on the
Maryland shore the summer zephyrs sing sweet benisons
to the fair daughters of the Old Dominion.</p>

<p>And when I entered the feud of eleven years had
vanished. I could only blush and bow my acknowledgements.</p>

<p>With fond good-byes to Col. McCardell and Mr.
Pattison we departed in the mid-afternoon bound for
Mercerville by twilight in the hope that we would have
the following day to spend on Antietam battlefield. But
we had not reckoned with the elements. Four miles
below Williamsport a terrific storm burst upon us. So
sudden was the tempest that we were obliged to tie to
the towpath bank to prevent the furious gales of wind
from capsizing the boat. For a few minutes it seemed
that our canopy would be torn to tatters. Our lines
gave way and I climbed out to steady the heaving craft.
Then it rained in such torrents that it momentarily took
away my breath. Vivid flashes of lightning and deafening
thunder followed in instant succession. The wind
wrenched big sycamores from their roots and they
crashed across the miry towpath like jackstraws thrown
by an angry giant. The storm lasted more than an hour
but a steady patter of rain followed. Our supplies
stored under the deck and protected by the poncho were
dry, but our clothes were dripping and the temperature
had turned chill and raw. Darkness was coming on and
we prepared to tie up for the night. How bright and
warm looked the blue flame from the canned alcohol
while we boiled our coffee!</p>

<p>It was a gloomy outlook, but southern hospitality
which proved the silver lining to every dark cloud on
our cruise, once more intervened. A farmer rode down
the towpath and invited us to go to his house for the
night. Our good Samaritan was Mr. J. H. Wine, whose
home nestles snugly under the mountain beside the
canal. We accepted with haste that we hoped would indicate
our extreme gratitude and soon had our dripping
duds spread out on the backs of chairs before the range
in the spacious kitchen. Mr. and Mrs. Wine tendered us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the guest room and we sought slumber early. Only the
outdoor enthusiast would have been worthy of the frugal
breakfast in the morning. We thanked our good
hosts and prepared to depart. The question of remuneration
for favors invariably was spurned by the hospitable
people on the canal.</p>

<p>The sun came out gloriously and we hoped to reach
Mercerville by noon. We did, but there the motor balked
again and we spent two hours trying to fix it. We gave
up the thought of visiting Antietam and about the time
the shadows began to lengthen, started solemnly toward
Shepherdstown, five honest miles down the canal. We
paddled and towed alternately, making even slower
progress than in the wake of No. 18. Darkness came
on and we were still on the lonely path. About 9 o'clock
we reached a lock and were told that Shepherdstown was
still a mile beyond. A storm was gathering and the
lockmaster invited us to tie up and spend the night in his
house notwithstanding that it would place several members
of his large family at an inconvenience. We agreed
to leave the boat, but insisted on going to Shepherdstown
where we could find a hotel and a garage mechanic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>AGAINST the protests of the lockmaster and his wife
we lighted our lantern and started down the lonely
towpath. Black clouds obscured the sky and
we stumbled along at times having difficulty in keeping
on the path. Flashes of lightning and rumbling thunder
betokened a storm that would rival the one on the previous
night. Our lantern's flickering light only intensified
the darkness but the lightning frequently assisted us
when its glare illuminated the entire landscape.</div>

<p>In our race with the storm we were the first under
the wire. Fleeing across the bridge over the Potomac
we breathlessly climbed the hill and along a dark street
to the center of the town whither we had been directed
to the hotel. Suddenly we rounded a corner into an
electric-lighted thoroughfare and stood before the entrance
of the Rumsey House. Our clothes were wrinkled
and we were splashed with mud from head to foot. We
still carried our lighted lantern and the crowd at the
hotel gazed at us with expressions twixt curiosity and
amazement. The proprietor was moved to commiseration.</p>

<p>"Come in here, you-all, right away," he said.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap2'>THE hallowed notes of church chimes awakened us
on our first morning in Shepherdstown and before
the day was an hour older we felt grateful to the
motor for compelling our stop-over in this quaint community.
Geographically Shepherdstown is in West Virginia,
but politically, socially and traditionally it leans
toward the Old Dominion. It lies in Jefferson county at
the foot of the beautiful Shenandoah valley and is essentially
southern. Its whole atmosphere and the sympathy
of its people belong distinctly to Piedmont Virginia.
It is the Alsace-Lorraine of America.</div>

<p>Next to Alexandria, Shepherdstown is perhaps the
oldest important settlement in the Potomac valley. It
is one of the few old towns in the country that has
not been defaced by too much present day progress.
Shepherdstown has always been a substantial prosperous
place and does not affect the gewgaws of the new
rich municipality. In some respects it resembles Concord,
Massachusetts. Its streets have many features in
common with the thoroughfares of the old-time New
England towns. In many of the residences are preserved
some of the most striking characteristics of
chaste colonial architecture.</p>

<p>It was a restful place to spend Sunday and in the
evening we joined the villagers in a stroll through the
shady streets and out on the bluff overlooking the
Potomac. Here on the edge of the cliffs on a
natural base of limestone rock is an imposing shaft lately
erected to the memory of James Rumsey, Shepherdstown
pioneer and inventor of the steamboat. Rumsey,
you know, was the Langley of steam navigation. While
Prof. Langley originated the idea of the heavier than
air system of aeronautic transportation, his aeroplane,
upon which experiments were made on this same Potomac
river, was not perfected to the point of standing the
practical test. Two bicycle mechanics in Dayton, Ohio,
were destined to make a crowning achievement where
the scientist had failed. Posterity will demand that the
Wright brothers share their fame with Langley.</p>

</div>

<p>Although Robert Fulton is popularly credited with
the invention of the steamboat, he only perfected the
work which was started by Rumsey in the waters of the
Potomac at Shepherdstown in September, 1784. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a><br /><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
presence of George Washington a boat which ascended
the stream by mechanical appliances was exhibited by
Rumsey 23 years before Fulton's Clermont made its
memorable voyage on the Hudson.</p>

<p>The house in which Rumsey lived is one of the historic
landmarks of Shepherdstown. The inventor went
to Europe and built a new boat which made a successful
trip on the Thames in December, 1792. A few weeks
later sudden death in the very prime of life cut short
Rumsey's career.</p>

<p>In the Civil War Shepherdstown endured the agony
but shared little of the glory of battle. It is about
eight miles north of Harper's Ferry and less than four
miles west of Antietam. Skirmishes took place here
early in the war and in September, 1862, it saw Stonewall
Jackson's famous foot cavalry sprint through this
corner of Jefferson county in his encircling movement
for the capture of Harper's Ferry. A week later echoes
of the guns engaged in the bloody work at Antietam
reverberated against the hills around Shepherdstown and
on the afternoon of that 17th day of September hundreds
of mutilated men were carried into the village and
committed to the care of the townspeople.</p>

<p>The wounded were Confederate soldiers and from
the majority of homes in Shepherdstown had gone
fathers, sons, brothers to fight under Lee or Jackson.
Marie Blunt, one of the heroic women who assisted
caring for the wounded, in describing that melancholy
day, said:</p>

<p>"We went about our work with pale faces and trembling
hands, yet trying to appear composed for the sake
of our patients, who were much excited. We could hear
the incessant explosions of artillery, the shrieking whistling
of the shells, and the sharper, deadlier, more thrilling
roll of musketry: while every now and then the
echo of some charging cheer would come, borne by the
wind, and as the human voice pierced that demoniacal
clangor we would catch our breath and listen, and try
not to sob, and turn back to forlorn hospitals, to the
suffering at our feet and before our eyes, while imagination
fainted at the thought of those other scenes hidden
from us beyond the Potomac.</p>

<p>"On our side of the river there were noise, confusion,
dust; throngs of stragglers; horsemen galloping
about; wagons blocking each other, and teamsters
wrangling; and a continued din of shouting, swearing
and rumbling, in the midst of which men were dying,
fresh wounded arriving, surgeons amputating limbs and
dressing wounds, women going in and out with bandages,
lint, medicines, food. An everpresent sense of anguish,
dread, pity, and, I fear, hatred&mdash;these are my recollections
of Antietam."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>LEAVING our invalid motor in care of a garage mechanic
we boarded a Norfolk &amp; Western train
Monday morning to visit Antietam battlefield. It is
a ride of less than 10 minutes from Shepherdstown to
the station of Antietam which is adjacent to the village
of Sharpsburg. The half a century that has passed since
the war has witnessed but slight change here. Nearly all
the houses are of the antebellum type. The woods have
been cleared at various places over the field, but otherwise
the landscape has changed but little when compared
with wartime photographs and sketches of the
battle.</div>

<p>A walk through the town and the national cemetery
brought us to the Hagerstown pike which parallels
the battle lines on the northern half of the field.
Threatening weather called for haste and I was obliged
to forego the pleasure of a ramble to familiar scenes
around the picturesque Burnside bridge which I had
photographed 11 years before. We were interested in
two parts of the field&mdash;the line of Anderson's Confederate
division and the position occupied by Hooker on
the Union right. In locating the former we soon found
ourselves in Piper's lane and walked down to the gray
stone barn which stands as solid today as on that Wednesday
afternoon when Hill and Sumner struggled for
the mastery of this blood-drenched farmstead.</p>

<p>Less than a mile beyond is the little whitewashed
Dunker church which marks the key to Stonewall Jackson's
position. It stands in the woods at the west side
of the Hagerstown pike at the intersection of the Smoketown
road. On the east side of the pike was the famous
cornfield where the Union soldiers under Hooker
and Mansfield engaged in deadly combat with Jackson's
men. In an area covering a few acres the losses on
both sides in less than four hours' fighting on the morning
of September 17th probably exceeded 5,000 killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>All the important positions occupied by the troops
on both sides have been marked by tablets erected by
the Federal government and many memorials have been
placed by the various states. One of the most interesting
monuments is that of the State of Maryland to her
sons&mdash;Union and Confederate&mdash;who perished at Antietam.
It stands on a knoll a short distance east of the
pike opposite the Dunker church.</p>

<p>At 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning, July 25, our motor
having been pronounced "cured," we slipped "Sometub's"
moorings and after adieus to hospitable friends
in Shepherdstown, started on the second half of our
journey. A mile and a half below the town we passed
the ford over which Lee's army retreated from Antietam
and saw the cliff where the Corn Exchange regiment
came to grief in its pursuit of the Confederates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
A little farther on we noted what we supposed was the
site of Camp McAuley where the One Hundred and
Fifty-fifth Pennsylvania regiment from Pittsburgh spent
many a chilly bivouac in the autumn of 1862.</p>

<p>The scenery on the canal between Shepherdstown
and Harper's Ferry is not rivaled anywhere in the country
for its variety, abounding in pastoral beauty, historic
interest and sublime grandeur. Our motor, being
on its good behavior, the trip was uneventful. Across
the river among the trees we descried the little hamlet
of Falling Waters where occurred one of the first conflicts
of the Civil War. We glided over Antietam creek
through a picturesque aqueduct and continued for miles
on through the trees at the base of the lofty cliffs of
Maryland Heights.</p>

<p>After several stops to catch the pictures that presented
themselves at every turn, we reached the lock opposite
Harper's Ferry about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
We threw "Sometub's" line to a picket fence beside the
canal and hastened across to the town to call at the postoffice
to receive an accumulation of 10 days' mail that
had been forwarded from point to point all the way
from Hancock.</p>

<p>This is a late day to describe Harper's Ferry. Thomas
Jefferson more than 100 years ago wrote a description
of the place and stole the thunder from his successors
for all time to come. In October, 1859, old John Brown
in a different manner gave fresh fame to the locality,
and on a gallows over the hills at Charles Town paid the
penalty with his life. Harper's Ferry got into the headlines
soon after Fort Sumter was fired upon and kept in
the limelight till the very close of the war. Since that
time the Baltimore and Ohio railroad has appropriated
the old town, mountains, rivers, scenery, historic associations
and all and has overlooked no opportunity to exploit
its beauty and its traditions.</p>

<p>We had expected to have a veritable field day here
with our camera, but when we came from the postoffice
clouds rolled down from the mountains like great avalanches
of snowy feathers, the village grew misty and
rain began to fall. With no immediate prospect of clear
weather we decided to continue our voyage. It would
be heresy, however, not to present a picture of Harper's
Ferry, and we are indebted to Mr. J. Hampton Baumgartner,
of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, for the
one presented here. The railroad has acted the pious
antiquarian in preserving this historic shrine and the
fame of the sacred spot is perpetuated largely through
the services of this corporation. Railroads more frequently
are ruthless vandals in their treatment of historic landmarks,
but not so with the Baltimore and Ohio. This
portion of the railroad is itself a talisman of history
worthy of every patriotic American's interest and study.</p>

<div class="caption">Harper's Ferry, from Maryland Heights</div>
</div>

<p>Rain was falling in torrents when we unleashed
"Sometub" from the picket fence and started through
the lock. By the time the one-armed locktender had
opened the gates and we chugged out under the Baltimore
and Ohio bridge at the entrance of the Maryland
Heights tunnel the storm had grown to the proportions
of a cloudburst. We found ourselves in a canyon of
concrete with a sharp curve ahead. It was a perilous
place to meet a canal boat and we continued on through
the blinding storm. At the end of the canyon we moored
to the towpath bank for a time, but with darkness approaching
and the rain continuing unabated, we resolved
to resume the voyage.</p>

<p>At dusk we reached Brunswick. Everything above
board on the boat, including ourselves was drenched.
Scrambling out on the towpath I waded through the mud
to inquire of the locktender for a place to tie up. Despite
the rain, we had decided to spend the night on
"Sometub." We had become so attached to the little
craft by this time that it seemed like ingratitude to go to
a comfortable hotel and leave it out there in the storm
and the night.</p>

<p>But this was not to be.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>V.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap2'>THERE must have been something about the appearance
of our outfit or ourselves, or both, on the
arrival of the bedraggled "Sometub" at Brunswick
calculated to awaken the deepest sympathy of the
kind-hearted folk who watched us approach through the
chilly rain. When I asked the lockmaster for a suitable
place to tie up for the night he pointed to a dilapidated
dock on the berm bank adjacent to an ancient
and densely populated pig pen.</div>

<p>"It would be very fine, except for the neighbors," I
told him. "Pigs have a habit of getting up too early
in the morning to suit us." This was not quite the reason
for our objection to mooring beside a pig pen, but I
aimed to be diplomatic. Perhaps they might be his
pigs. "Crackey!" exclaimed the lockmaster, "You-all
don't intend to spend the night in that boat, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "We have the most comfortable
cabin you ever saw."</p>

<p>Before the lockmaster could answer another man,
who hastened over from the railroad yards, at once
assumed the role of superintendent of the harbor, collector
of the port, quarantine officer or whatever you
would choose to call him. He spoke with the air of a
person clothed with absolute authority.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; tie up over there and I'll&mdash;&mdash;" he
began.</p>

<p>"I have just told the lockmaster that I'll not tie up
over there," I interposed. But our new friend disregarded
me entirely and continued:</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;I'll have an automobile here in five minutes
to take you and the missus up to the hotel. Your boat
will be safe till morning. Come from Pittsburgh, eh?
How in Sam Hill did you get into the canal? I used to
work in Pittsburgh, but that was a good while ago.
Pretty big place now, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was true to his word. An automobile oozed
through the mud and the chauffeur announced that he
was ready to take "the lady and gentleman to the hotel."
In the presence of such an example of prompt service
we reconsidered our resolution to spend the night in
the boat and taking our baggage, we went to the hotel
in our khakis. The people in the lobby must have
thought that unkempt members of a band of gypsies had
invaded the place when we rushed through to our room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
However, the opinions of bystanders as to the appearance
of our traveling duds gave us little concern. We
put on dry clothes and in a few minutes it was announced
that the dining room had been opened for our
especial benefit. The young wife of the proprietor
cooked and served a bountiful repast. She must have
felt repaid for the effort by the manner in which we dispatched
all the good things she had prepared.</p>

<p>The rain lasted through the night but Wednesday,
July 26th, dawned with clear skies. We prepared to depart
early, but first stocked "Sometub" with provisions
and fuel, Brunswick being the last large town on the
canal on the way to Washington. Before us for a distance
of nearly 50 miles lay a stretch of sparsely settled
country. From Brunswick to Point of Rocks the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad runs close beside the towpath
and in the early morning, "Sometub" was greeted
several times by passengers on the observation cars of
the Royal Blue express trains which dashed by at a
mile-a-minute speed. We wondered if the people who
were fluttering handkerchiefs and waving hats envied
us. It was while riding on the observation car several
years ago on this same route that we had planned our
voyage. In its realization we regretted that more vacation
tourists could not share the pleasure of our trip
over the mountains&mdash;by water. We did not stop to consider
that the majority of summer travelers desire speed,
luxury and the least discomfort and would balk at the
petty annoyances we endured through an obstinate motor
and the omniesence of Jupiter Pluvius.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of old Catoctin mountain we passed
the Point of Rocks, famous in the Civil War as the
place where Lee's army crossed for the invasion of
Maryland in the Antietam campaign. A few miles beyond
the course of the river turns from southeast to
southwest and we sheered off sharply from the railroad.
We crossed on the famous stone aqueduct over the
Monocacy river. The character of the scenery changed
quite as preceptibly as the direction of the stream.
Through the drooping branches of the trees we saw on
the north the rugged outlines of old Sugar Loaf peak
and across the Potomac the undulating ridge of the
southern spur of Catoctin, and when heights faded in
the blue haze of a midsummer day, we bade farewell
to the mountains. Henceforth our way ran through the
lowlands down to the sea, the hills and river bluffs
reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet.</p>

<p>At Edwards Ferry we saw the wooded face of Ball's
Bluff which gave name to a Civil War conflict which was
second only to Bull Run in causing discomfiture to the
people of the North. In this little fight the country lost
a notable figure in the person of General Edward D.
Baker, first United States senator from Oregon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>For miles along this portion of our route we ran
without seeing a human habitation. A dense strip
of woodland concealed the river from view and bluffs
or marshy thickets interposed between the canal and the
country to the north. Occasionally through the trees
we caught a fleeting glimpse of beautiful meadows and
cornfields of the Maryland farmlands, but these vistas
were rare.</p>

<p>At White's Ferry, where on September 5th, 1862,
Stonewall Jackson's army forded the Potomac, and
while singing "My Maryland," marched gallantly on
toward Frederick, we stopped under the highway bridge
that spans the canal to replenish our supply of gasoline.
Leaning over the rail of the bridge stood a native whose
face was obscured by the shadow of a straw hat of immense
brim. Over his shoulder was a fishing-pole of a
length of thirty feet or more. He ignored our salutation
when we approached, but after we had drifted under the
bridge he crossed to the rail on the other side and inquired:</p>

<p>"Stranger, whar did you put that tub in this ditch?"</p>

<p>"Cumberland."</p>

<p>"By crackey!" And he sauntered down the road.</p>

<p>The history of this "ditch" is a commercial romance
closely linked with the political developments of the last
one hundred and fifty years. During the period immediately
preceding the Revolutionary War Washington
devoted his chief attention toward the opening of the
west to colonization and for a cheap transportation
route foresaw that navigation on the waters of the
upper Potomac would offer a direct outlet for the products
of the agricultural regions of the western country
to the Atlantic seaboard. The alarm from Lexington in
1775, of course, put an end to all immediate plans for
the internal improvement among the colonies, but after
Burgoyne had been cut off at Saratoga and Cornwallis
had been bagged at Yorktown, Gen Washington again
turned his attention to the transportation problem. Before
peace was restored he left the camp of the patriot
army at Newburg and inspected the future route of the
Erie canal through the Mohawk valley.</p>

<p>Washington shrewdly divined that a canal between
Lake Erie near Niagara, connecting it with the Mohawk
and the Hudson would open up a route that would be a
dangerous competitor to the southern colonies in their
trade with the west. Soon after he was relieved from
his military duties he made a tour of exploration with a
view of locating a route connecting the Potomac with the
Ohio and the Great Lakes. His journal sets forth
clearly his wonderful farsightedness and broad comprehension
of the situation. Here is Washington's report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of his transportation line from Detroit to Alexandria,
Va.: (The spelling is Washington's).</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the "mouth of the Yohiogany" is
now McKeesport, that the "falls to ditto" indicates Ohio
Pyle and that "Three Forks" means the present locality
of Confluence, and compare the distances with present
day surveys. They will not vary a mile on the entire
stretch. Ask the eminent engineers of the Lake Erie &amp;
Ohio River Canal if they can add much to Washington's
ideas. Their answer will give you added reasons for
celebrating on the 22nd of next February.</p>

<p>In February, 1785, the laws were passed by the
legislatures of Maryland and Virginia authorizing the
formation of a company for the improvement of the Potomac
river and books for the subscription of stock were
opened at once. The total shares were 403 and the
capital of the new Potomac Company was 40,300 pounds.
Washington was elected its president and James Rumsey,
the inventor, whose monument we saw at Shepherdstown,
was general manager. In the summer of
1785 the work of blasting rock and other obstructions
was begun between Great Falls and Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>The work was prosecuted with vigor, but during
the winter of 1786-87 there came a hint of labor troubles.
Common laborers were paid 32 shillings (about
$8.00) a month "with the usual ration except spirits,
and with such reasonable allowance of spirits as the
manager may from time to time think proper." The
question of spirits seems to have been the chief cause
of the trouble, for it is recorded that the company contracted
for the supply of rum at "two shillings per gallon."
It must have been the same kind of stuff that is
peddled across the river to "dry" Virginians today.</p>

<p>In 1787 Washington withdrew from active work in
the company to accept the presidency of the Republic.
His retirement sealed the fate of the corporation. Its
affairs languished for years and in 1823 was declared
defunct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same year&mdash;1823 a date since famous for the
promulgation of the Monroe doctrine&mdash;the navigation
project was again revived in the Maryland legislature.
It was estimated that the proposed work of cutting a
canal from tide-water (Washington, D. C.) up the Potomac,
across the mountains to a branch of the Ohio, and
down the same, at $1,500,000, of which Virginia, Maryland
and the District of Columbia were each to subscribe
one-third. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company
was incorporated by the Maryland legislature in 1825
with a capital stock of $6,000,000, Congress having previously
made an appropriation of $30,000 for preliminary
surveys. The route selected for the canal alarmed the
citizens of Baltimore. They saw that it would divert
trade from their city. About this time Philip E. Thomas,
a Baltimore banker, and George Brown, an enterprising
resident of that city, took earnest counsel between themselves
to save the traffic for their town. On the 19th of
February, 1827, they held a meeting with their townsmen
which was destined to become memorable in the whole
history of transportation.</p>

<div class="caption">Tom Thumb&mdash;B. &amp; O. 1830</div>
</div>

<p>Up in Quincy, Mass., and in Maunch Chaunk, Pa.,
for a year or two wagons had been operated on rails,
and Mr. Thomas inquired of his confreres why a "rail
road" would not be practicable from Baltimore to the
Ohio. The whole world knows the answer: On February
28, 1828, a charter was granted to the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company, Mr. Thomas resigned the presidency
of the Machanics' Bank in Baltimore to become
the head of the first American railway system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>THEN began a memorable commercial race between
canal and railroad. Their prospective routes were
parallel and both sought the same destination&mdash;the Ohio
river at Pittsburgh. Early in 1826 both companies were
in the field surveying for their respective highways. On
the fourth of July succeeding celebrations were planned
by the rival corporations. In Washington on that day
President John Quincy Adams, the members of his cabinet,
foreign ambassadors, survivors of the Revolutionary
War and a great throng of citizens proceeded up the
Potomac to Great Falls where the first spadeful of earth
in the construction of the canal was turned by the President
of the United States.</div>

<p>Over in Baltimore at the same hour the venerable
Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the only surviving signer
of the Declaration of Independence lifted a spadeful of
earth in placing the foundation stone to commemorate
the commencement of the building of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad. The railroad was completed to the Maryland
shore opposite Harper's Ferry in 1834 and was
opened to operation December 1, the work on the canal
at that time having proceeded more rapidly, despite injunctions,
financial embarrassments and a multitude of
obstacles that interfered with the work. The canal finally
was completed to Cumberland February 17, 1851.</p>

<p>In the meantime the railroad had struggled to success
in spite of similar obstacles. The Baltimore and
Ohio was opened to the public May 22, 1830, and was
received with approbation of the public. At this time
the line extended from Baltimore to Ellicott's Mills, a
distance of 12 miles. It was advertised that "brigades
of cars left Baltimore at 6 and 10 a. m. and 3 and 4
p. m." These "brigades" of cars first were hauled by
horses and mules and later a brother of President
Thomas invented a car which moved by sails. The
superintendent of motive power, nevertheless, was enterprising
and steam was soon applied. As early as 1831
the company offered a prize of $4,000 for the best locomotive
offered for trial on the road. It is a curious fact
that a watchmaker of York, Pa., built the first practicable
models.</p>

<p>One of these, the "Atlantic," on August 25, 1835,
drew the first train into Washington amid the applause
of President Andrew Jackson and a distinguished assemblage.
This "grasshopper" locomotive was in use a
generation later when it hauled the vanguard of Union
soldiers to save the national capital in 1861. It developed
a speed of 30 miles an hour which was regarded
as suicidal in the early days of railroading. Although
superannuated, the "Atlantic" is still in a good state of
preservation and can be operated under its own power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The canal and railroad are no longer competitors.
The bonds of the former company are held by the railroad.
The canal is in operation during the season of
navigation and more than 100 boats are engaged in providing
low-priced transportation for coal from Cumberland
to the seaboard. On the railroad "brigades of
cars" are seen at intervals of a few minutes dashing
along behind locomotives that weight more than twenty
times that of the little old "Atlantic."</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap2'>THROUGH the sultry afternoon of Wednesday, July
25th, "Sometub" ran for hours under the willows
that fringe the Maryland meadows in Montgomery
county. Across the river the Virginia shore presented
an endless panorama of wooded hills that grew less
rugged in their outlines as we proceeded down the
stream. At sunset we were running through a marshy
region and decided to keep on rather than invite malaria
by spending the night on the border of a swamp. We
were happy when, in the receding twilight, we espied
the hills of Seneca creek and knew by consulting our
topographical maps that we would have a more healthy
mooring place. At Seneca a widewater covers about ten
acres and under a big sycamore tree beside the little
lake we tied "Sometub," preparing dinner on our
"canned heat" range and serving it on our poncho which
was spread on the soft, green turf.</div>

<p>The dying embers of a campfire were visible across
an arm of the lake and after dinner we went to pay a
neighborly call. Beside the fire was a tiny "pup" tent
supported by two canoe paddles. On our approach three
young men greeted us. A week before, they told us,
they had started out from their homes in Washington
on a fishing trip up the river. In the Potomac the bass
were not biting but the mosquitoes were and betwixt
hope and desperation they had turned into the canal.
Now they were having fairly good luck and were comfortable.</p>

<p>Our new friends punctilously returned the call.
One of the youths was the son of a naval officer and
expressed much interest in "Sometub," and its unique
cabin arrangement. We sat in the lantern light till midnight
swapping motorboat experiences for fish stories.
In this we had the better of the deal.</p>

<p>Thursday dawned clear and hot. Our neighbors,
the fishermen, were out before sunrise and had breakfasted
on their catch of perch, catfish and "sunnies"
before we were stirring. Old Sol drank up the dew within
a few minutes after his appearance over the Virginia
hills and we made an excursion into a blackberry
thicket where we picked a dish of luscious fruit for
breakfast. It was our last berry feast of the season.
After reciprocating photographs of our respective
"camps," we headed for Seneca lock and were lowered
through it by members of a troop of Washington Boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Scouts who volunteered their assistance to the lockmaster.</p>

<p>At noon we reached Great Falls. Here are 13 locks
in a series of two, seven chambers in the first and six
in the second. The actual time in making the descent
was considerably less than two hours. We stopped at
the first lock, and upon payment of a small fee to the
lockmaster, were admitted to the private park surrounding
the Great Falls of the Potomac. Crossing a swinging
bridge to an island in the river we obtained a magnificent
view of the cataract. The stream was at flood
stage and the scene rivaled the rapids of the lower
Niagara.</p>

<p>In the late summer and autumn of 1861 the Union
and Confederate pickets frequently exchanged compliments
at short range from behind the rocks and boulders
along this stretch of the Potomac. If you have any
friends among the survivors of the Pennsylvania Reserves,
ask them to tell you of their experiences during
the open season for snipers in those exciting days.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon we passed Cabin
John bridge and moored "Sometub" at the lock at the
foot of Glen Echo park. In the shade of the trees everything
looked cool and refreshing and we decided to
spend the evening with friends in Washington, but a
few minutes after we stepped off the boat we realized
that it was the hottest day of the summer. The lockmaster's
wife invited us to go into her house and assigned
us "spare rooms" to change our clothes. Going
to Washington by trolley, we found the heat in the city
almost intolerable after our fortnight in the open air
of the mountains. After dinner in town against the
protests of friends we returned to the boat and were
lulled to slumber by the music in the dancing pavilion
of the park.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class='drop-cap2'>JUPITER PLUVIUS had been on hand at the beginning
of the voyage and now at its close he was in evidence
again. Rain interrupted us at breakfast and continued
through the forenoon. Disregarding the showers
we started on the last lap of our cruise and at 11 o'clock
reached Lock No. 1, or, according to our count, No. 75
from Cumberland. We surrendered our waybill with
the request that the canal company would return it to
us to keep as a souvenir. After a pleasant chat to the
lockmaster during which time we took refuge from a
particularly annoying shower, "Sometub" was lowered
to the Georgetown level. A few minutes later the lofty
towers supporting the arials of the naval radio station at
Arlington were visible and rounding a majestic curve to
the eastward, we beheld the fantastic skyline of the
National Capital.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Threading our way between a fleet of canal boats,
tugs, skiffs and nondescript craft we reached the coal
wharf in Georgetown and ran "Sometub" into the mud at
the ancient lock which connects the canal with Rock
creek, its outlet into the waters of the Potomac. The
waterfront at Georgetown is no prepossessing place and
the attitude of the bystanders was not calculated to lead
the boatman to leave his property unguarded. Asking
the obliging lockmaster to "keep an eye" on "Sometub"
I went up a side street to the office of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Canal Company to report our arrival
and to meet in person Mr. A. Sahli, the secretary, with
whom I had had an interesting telephone conversation
last winter when in Washington arranging for the
voyage.</p>

<p>Mr. Sahli had been most obliging and we felt grateful
for his advice. He told me that a short distance below
the lock at the railroad yards I could take the boat
from the water and ship it back to Pittsburgh. It seemed
that every possible convenience was provided for the
skipper directing a "portable cruise."</p>

<p>I cannot describe my feelings when I returned to
the wharf. We refused to realize that our voyage was
at an end. It seemed that to take down the canopy, pack
our stores and utensils and lift "Sometub" from the
water would leave us absolutely homeless. It was still
raining. For a long time we sat in the boat debating
what to do. It was Friday and we had three days remaining
on our hands. The little boat never looked more
friendly, cozy and hospitable than just now. We had
been companions on a most interesting journey and to
leave it to pursue our own pleasure was like parting
with a faithful partner in adversity.</p>

<p>We compromised by exploring new waters. Giving
the signal to the lockmaster, we were lowered into Rock
creek and started up that winding stream toward Rock
Creek park where we hoped to find a quiet place to tie
up. We ran under the arched bridge of Pennsylvania
avenue and under the trees to a point at the foot of the
hill below DuPont circle but here shoal water checked
our progress. Reluctantly we turned back and ran out
to the dam where the creek empties into the Potomac.
Here our cruise came near terminating in a tragedy.
We were within 30 yards of the dam before we saw that
water to a depth of a foot or more was pouring over
its crest into the swirling river 15 feet below. The motor
refused to reverse. We were caught in the current and
drifted broadside toward the dam.</p>

<p>Then we learned that a spruce canoe paddle is the
most reliable of all motors for a small boat in moments
of emergency. It was impossible to stem the current,
but we succeeded in edging off from the middle of the
stream and when almost at the edge of the dam caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
some wisps of willows and held "Sometub" until a line
was thrown ashore.</p>

<p>After extricating ourselves from this predicament
we ran back to the entrance of the canal and met a great,
whole-souled man in the person of Mr. Michael O'Leary,
night watchman in a machine shop on the river front and
the owner of a houseboat in Rock Creek. True to all
the virtues of his nationality, Mr. O'Leary possesses a
generous heart and bountiful hospitality. Shure, it
would be all right to tie up to his boat and he would be
plased to keep an eye on the wee tub.</p>

<p>Honesty was written all over his face and we left
"Sometub" in his care, going downtown to spend another
evening with friends but returned at night to our cabin.
Saturday morning we were confronted by the inevitable
necessity of "taking down" the superstructure of the
boat and packing our baggage. Mr. O'Leary was on
hand with a group of longshoremen who lifted "Sometub"
from the water and carried it to a freight car as if
it were a toy. We felt homeless now indeed. Only the
refreshing good humor of Michael O'Leary mellowed
our regret that our voyage was at an end.</p>

<p>"Sometub" in its freight car berth started that night
on its return to Pittsburgh for many subsequent weekend
excursions on the Allegheny, but we tarried a day
longer. On Sunday morning we crossed over to Virginia
and went to old Christ Church in Alexandria.
There in that historic temple of worship, with its sacred
memories of George Washington, we rounded our fortnight's
journey. From first to last we had followed in
the footsteps of the greatest American.</p>
